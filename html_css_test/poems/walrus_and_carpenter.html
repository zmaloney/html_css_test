	<blockquote>
	The sun was shining on the sea,<br/>
	Shining with all his might:<br/>
	He did his very best to make<br/>
	The billows smooth and bright--<br/>
	And this was odd, because it was<br/>
	The middle of the night.<br/>  
	</blockquote>
</p>
<p id="verse_2">         
	<blockquote>
	The moon was shining sulkily,<br/>
	Because she thought the sun<br/>
	Had got no business to be there<br/>
	After the day was done--<br/>
	"It's very rude of him," she said,<br/>
	"To come and spoil the fun!"<br/>      
	</blockquote>
</p>
<p id="verse_3">      
	<blockquote>
	The sea was wet as wet could be,<br/>
	The sands were dry as dry.<br/>
	You could not see a cloud, because<br/>
	No cloud was in the sky:<br/>
	No birds were flying overhead--<br/>
	There were no birds to fly.<br/>    
	</blockquote>
</p>   
<p id="verse_4">    
	<blockquote>
	The Walrus and the Carpenter<br/>
	Were walking close at hand;<br/>
	They wept like anything to see<br/>
	Such quantities of sand:<br/>
	"If this were only cleared away,"<br/>
	They said, "it would be grand!"<br/>    
	</blockquote>
</p>    
<p id="verse_5">
	<blockquote>
	"If seven maids with seven mops<br/>
	Swept it for half a year.<br/>
	Do you suppose," the Walrus said,<br/>
	"That they could get it clear?"<br/>
	"I doubt it," said the Carpenter,<br/>
	And shed a bitter tear.<br/>
	</blockquote>
</p>    
<p id="verse_6">
	<blockquote>
	"O Oysters, come and walk with us!"<br/>
	The Walrus did beseech.<br/>
	"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,<br/>
	Along the briny beach:<br/>
	We cannot do with more than four,<br/>
	To give a hand to each."<br/>
	</blockquote>  
</p>  
<p id="verse_7">
 	<blockquote>
	The eldest Oyster looked at him,<br/> 
	But never a word he said:<br/> 
	The eldest Oyster winked his eye,<br/> 
	And shook his heavy head--<br/> 
	Meaning to say he did not choose<br/> 
	To leave the oyster-bed.<br/>
