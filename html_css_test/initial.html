<h2>The Walrus and the Carpenter</h2>
<ol>
	<li>The sun was shining on the sea,</li>
	<li>Shining with all its might.</li>
	<li>It did its very best to make</li>
	<li>The billows smooth and bright</li>
	<li>And this was odd, because it was</li>
	<li>The middle of the night.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>The moon was shining sulkily</li>
	<li>Because she thought the sun</li>
	<li>Had got no business to be there</li>
	<li>After the day was done.</li>
	<li>"It's very rude of him," she said,</li>
	<li>"To come and spoil the fun."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
	<dt>The sand was wet as wet could be,</dt>
	<dd>The sea was dry as dry.</dd>
	<dt>You could not see a cloud, because</dt>
	<dd>No cloud was in the sky.</dd>
	<dt>No birds were flying overhead--</dt>
	<dd>There were no birds to fly.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
	<li>The walrus and the carpenter</li>
	<ul>Were walking close at hand.
		<li>They wept like anything to see</li>
		<li>Such quantities of sand.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>"If this were only cleared away,"
		<li>They said, "it would be grand!"</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
